# Cryptography Android Application

The project aims at the creation of a “Cryptography Application” using Android. In this application there are four different Algorithms are used for encrypt and
decrypt the data in Android Phones The main purpose of developing a cryptosystem is to protect the user’s data privacy. Information is transferred from one user to another. In that case,possibilities of data losing or stealing data still remain there. So it is necessary for us to inspect the overall access of data from any unauthorized public. So, to protect the information from being lost , encryption using cryptosystem is necessary.
**Algorithms:**
● Advanced Encryption Standard
● Vigenere Cipher
● Caesar Cipher
● Binary Algorithm

**Advanced Encryption Standard Algorithm :**
The Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm is a symmetrical block cipher algorithm that takes plain text in blocks of 128 bits
and converts them to ciphertext using keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits.
**Vigenere cipher Algorithm:**
The Vigenere Cipher is an algorithm of encrypting an alphabetic text that uses a series of interwoven caesar ciphers. It is based on a
keyword's letters. It uses a Vigenere table or Vigenere square for encryption and decryption of the text.
**Caesar cipher Algorithm:**
A Caesar Cipher is a simple method of encoding messages. Caesar ciphers use a substitution method where letters in the alphabet
are shifted by some fixed number of spaces to yield an encoding alphabet. A Caesar cipher with a shift of 1 would encode an A as a B, an M as an N, and a Z
as an A
**Binary Algorithm:**
An encryption algorithm is the method used to transform data into ciphertext In the binary algorithm, plain text converts into
binary format(‘1’,’0’) for cipher text.To decrypt the ciphertext into plain text,the binary number .we converted into plain textUsing the binary algorithm
